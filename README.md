* For the training - are you using a GPU or a CPU? Local machine or online 
resource? Any other details on the hardware or software configuration?
* Did you experience any memory of other difficulties with the image or data size?
* What does the model do if it receives an image that is not an x-ray (for example, a dog)?
* Did you consider or explore other CNN model architectures and other layers?
* Can you display graphs for the metrics over the training epochs (train loss, test loss, etc.)? What were the final numbers?
* How long did the training take?
Note that I deducted a few minor points from the ML grade due to the lack of information on other model hyperparameters that you may have tried and how you ended up with this exact model design.
