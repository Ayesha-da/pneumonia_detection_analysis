# Pneumonia Detection Analysis
A project by: Ayesha Shaheen, Chelsea Langford, Matthew Breitner, Nidhi Pandya, and William Johnson

## Project Overview
### Selected Topic
Our project will use neural networks and machine learning to interpret chest x-ray images and classify them as pneumonia vs. not pneumonia.
### Project Use Case
- The use case for generating this model is to develop a process to objectively analyze and interpret x-ray images with a rate of accuracy that is potentially better than the human eye.
- This model could be a valuable resource for doctors and students as another tool for interpreting x-ray images and validating/invalidating their personal diagnoses.
- Additionally, this model could be futher applied to chest x-rays with diagnoses outside of pneumonia and be adapted to interpret the x-rays of patients with other symptoms such as those suffering with long-term effects from COVID-19. 
### Questions to Answer
- Can a machine learning model find distinct differences in chest x-ray images and accurately classify them as pneumonia vs. not pneumonia?
- What level of accuracy can be achieved by this model? Can it be considered a reliable resource for individuals who are diagnosing patients?
- Long term, how can this model be applied to classifying other diagnoses based on x-ray image analysis?
- Can this model be generated without introducing bias?
