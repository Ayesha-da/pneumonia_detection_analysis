In Conventional Programming, decision making is based on IF-ELSE conditions. Therefore, many solutions cannot be modeled with it. One of the main reasons behind this is the variation of the input data variable, which increases the problem’s complexity. On the contrary, machine learning programming solves the problem by modeling the data with train data and test data. Based on these data and statistical models, machine learning predicts the result.

We are primarily working with images and we need a model to take in these images, process them and give us the desired output.
In deep learning, we will be using a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.

We choose convolutional neural network model since it takes in the data (images of chest x-ray) process them well  and predicts the images and classify them correctly as “normal” or “pneumonia”.
