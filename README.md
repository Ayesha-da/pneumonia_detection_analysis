* Hardware / Software configuration

   Google Compute Engine backend (GPU) and python 3.7, spyderIDE(v 5.1.5), flask, bootstrap, keras and tensorflow on local computer.
   
    For the model training we used google colab-GPU to run the model and process the charts. We encountered few issues while running model on local machine such as shutting down     of kernel due to delayed times.

* Did you experience any memory or other difficulties with the image or data size?
   
    Severe Overfitting, very long training time, installing new packages such as cvs and updating version of tensorflow.
